smoke_test.py  -  full offline end-to-end check. No network, no key, no mic.

Forces PROVIDER=mock and drives scripted turns through the REAL Agent + adaptor,
asserting that tools fire and control actions (transfer/hangup) surface. Run
this in CI or before a demo to confirm the loop is wired correctly.
